Has been both interviewer and interviewee, been more as interviewer than interviewee though. There is some interesting observations from both side.

Yes, it is definitely not the same as our day-to-day work, we do use whiteboard often, but not for coding, and we don't use fancy algorithm that often, in most of case, I would say. And, you may need some luck on what kind of interviewer you may encountered, not just the question itself. But, not matter we like it or not, there is some thing we are looking for during the process.
