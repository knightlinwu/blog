Yes, I am leaving Microsoft after 11 years and 6 months, my last day is Jun 28 2019. And I would like to share why I made this decision now. It may not be worth for you to get anything out of it, but I will share it anyway, as a way to document the journey for myself.

## It has been 11 years and 6 months
Looking back, my career within Microsoft can be summarized with few keywords: **Embedded, Web Platform, Performance and Architecture**. I had spent the majority of my career in **Web Platform**, looking at its **performance**(including memory optimization) and **stability**, building the **architecture** to get hosted as **browser (Microsoft Edge browser)** and **application framework (WWA - Windows Web Applications)**. In the recent 2.5 years (start in the end of 2016), I joined Microsoft Advertising team, mainly looked at **architecture of advertiser facing applications**, including **Web, Desktop and Mobile** applications. Along the way, I am also playing as **'fire fighter'** roles in the teams, working at the stability of applications, like memory leaks, memory corruptions, application crashes. It was a fun journey, and learnt a ton from the works and brilliant people around me, not only on **accumulating the technical knowledge**, but also on understanding how to **communicate efficiently** and **make things happened**, particularly, when having **bigger scope which across organization/teams** stuff to deal with. All the things used to be challenges **became great opportunities** to help me to **grow as individual, steady and confidently**. And, most importantly, beside the growth as individual, I get to make **great friends** and have **incredible mentors** along all the way. I realized how fortune I am to always have their invaluable help, trust and support. Microsoft is a great company with incredible peoples, now it is the time for me to follow the passion and say 'Bye'.

## Follow the passion
